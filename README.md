# Intro

Obcato is an initiative to offer a simple, modular and multi-language web content management system. Obcato is open-source, and therefore free. The idea behind a web content management system is to facilitate the creation of a website with as little technical or programming knowledge as possible. Creation of a website will involve the following activities:

* Programming Smarty Templates and configuring them in the Obcato management UI
* Authoring articles, pages, images, etc. in the Obcato UI

Templates will be linked to presentable elements in Obcato which will be rendered on the frontend, effectively converting the authored data into an HTML website.
