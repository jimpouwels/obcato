# Intro

Obcato is an initiative to offer a simple, modular and multi-language web content management system. Obcato is open-source, and therefore free. The idea behind a web content management system is to facilitate the creation of a website with as little technical or programming knowledge as possible. Creation of a website will involve the following activities:

* Programming Smarty Templates according to the Obcato API's and configuring them in the Obcato management UI.
* Authoring articles, pages, images, etc. in the Obcato UI. Templates will be linked to these presentable elements and will be rendered as HTML.
